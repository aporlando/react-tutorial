React Tutorial
==============
This is the implementation of the react tutorial found at [https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

The express server was created and simply allows the tutorial to get and post comments from the comment.json file dynamically. It also directly serves the index.html file from the root path.

Required to run this example:
node
express

In the example directory, run `node index.js`. This command will run the express server on localhost at port 3000.
Open the localhost:3000 in your browser.
